# Canvas Render Components (alpha)

**Super duper alpha.. Use at your own risk. lol**

The basic idea here is a "react-like" API that will create canvas "components" such that it handles:

1. Events over very specific areas of of the canvas, as defined by components.
2. Communicating state changes between components.
3. Ensuring that only what needs to be rendered is actually rendered.

There's a [playground link here on Stackblitz](https://stackblitz.com/fork/canvas-render-components).

## Known Issues and Missing Features

- **THERE ARE NO TESTS!! (duh, huge red flag!)**
- Missing events:
  - onMouseDown
  - onMouseUp
  - onKeyPress
  - onKeyDown
  - onKeyUp
  - touch events?
- Have yet to figure out focus management scheme
- Screen reader updates
- Components:
  - Ellipse? Circle?
  - Clipping: A component to define a clipping area? Maybe this could be done with the `g` component?
- Do I want to allow transformations (scale, rotate, etc) on other existing components?

## Getting Started

See storybook examples for usage.

Basically:

1. Define a component

```ts
import { defineComp, rect, text } from 'canvas-render-components';

function MyComp(props: MyCompProps, ctx: CanvasRenderingContext2D) => {
    // There are hooks like React, just prefixed with `crc` instead of use:
    const [count, setCount] = crcState(0);

    // You can return other crc elements, like react, but JSX is annoying to hook up
    // So I don't have that in this example:
    return [
        rect({
            x: 10,
            y: 10,
            width: 100,
            height: 100,
            fillStyle: 'blue',
            onClick: () => setCount(count + 1)
        }),
        text({
            x: 10,
            y: 10,
            width: 100,
            text: 'Click Me',
            fillStyle: 'white'
        })
    ];
}

export const myComp = defineComp(MyComp)
```

2. Mount the component to an existing `HTMLCanvasElement`:

```ts
import { myComp } from './MyComp';
import { crc } from 'canvas-render-components';

const canvas = document.querySelector('#my-canvas-id');
crc(canvas, myComp);
```

# API List

Sorry, this isn't really documentation, just the basic idea:

## Utilities

- `crc(canvasElement, crcElement)` - Mount or update an existing canvas element with a crc element
- `defineComp(compFn)` - used to create a more ergonomic means of consuming crc components and returning crc elements when setting up JSX is too annoying (it's always too annoying).

## Components

- `path`: Renders an arbitrary `Path2D`
- `rect`: Renders a rectangle
- `text`: Text rendering (including multiline, singleline, ellipsis overflow, etc)
- `line`: Renders a series of coordinates as connected line segments
- `verticalLine`/`horizontalLine` special components for rendering vertical or horizontal line segments, which includes a bit called `alignToPixelGrid` that allows you to ensure 1px lines are _really_ 1px. (it's a canvas quirk)
- `svgPath`: Renders svg path data as a shape
- `img`: Loads and renders an image
- `g`: A grouping component that allows the group application of transformations such as scale, rotation, etc.

## Hooks

- `crcRef` - basically a simplified version of react's `useRef`
- `crcState` - A simplified version of react's `useState`
- `crcMemo` - Basically react's `useMemo`. This is VERY useful for memoizing `Path2D` objects that need to be passed to other hooks. Strongly recommended for that use case.
- `crcWhenChanged` - Looks like react's `useEffect`.. it is **NOT**. It takes a callback that will execute _SYNCHRONOUSLY_ when dependencies change. It also allows the return of a teardown. This is specifically for use cases where one might need to execute some logic only when some dependencies change. **DO NOT USE if you need to _synchronously update some \_state_ when dependencies change, use `crcMemo` instead**.
- `crcCursor` - A hook to allow the setup of CSS cursor (pointer) changes when hovering a given `Path2D`.
- `crcClick`, `crcDblClick`, `crcMouseMove`, (et al)... Hooks to allow setup of events related to a given `Path2D`.
- `crcRectPath` - A simplified hook that returns a memoized `Path2D` for a rectangle (A common task).
- `crcLinePath` - A hook for memoized `Path2D` objects from coordinates.
- `crcSvgPath` - A hook for memoized `Path2D` objects from svg path data strings.
